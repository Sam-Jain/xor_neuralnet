# XOR problem solved using Neural Network and Machine Learning
This project involves 2 approaches to make and train a neural network to solve the basic XOR Problem.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites 
Since this project is implemented in Python, you need to know about basic programming in python.
Also, 2 external libraries are used which are:
1. Neuralpy
2. Numpy
To install these dependencies use
```
pip install numpy
pip install neuralpy
```
## Executing the code
Use an IDE or simply python command line to execute the programs.

## Built with
*PyCharm
