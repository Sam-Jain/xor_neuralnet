# XOR problem solved using Neural Network and Machine Learning
This project involves 2 approaches to make and train a neural network to solve the basic XOR Problem.
The first approach is using the Back Propagation Network using the numpy
and the second one using Feed Forward Network using neuralpy.
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites 
Since this project is implemented in Python, you need to know about basic programming in python.
Also, 2 external libraries are used which are:
1. Neuralpy
2. Numpy
To install these dependencies use
```
pip install numpy
pip install neuralpy
```
## Executing the code
Use an IDE or simply python command line to execute the programs.

## Output
### For Feed Forward Network
> [0.967022732]
> [0.034269741]
> [0.954815775]
> [0.042835310]

### For Back Propagation Network
> Output After Training
> [0.00966449]
> [0.00786506]
> [0.99358898]
> [0.99211957]
